### Problem Statement :
The ability to communicate with one another is a fundamental part of our daily life. There are nearly
7,000 different languages worldwide. As our world becomes increasingly connected, language
translation provides a critical cultural and economic bridge between people from different countries
and ethnic groups. Some of the more obvious use-cases include:
* **Business:** international trade, investment, contracts, finance
* **Commerce:** travel, purchase of foreign goods and services, customer support
* **Media:** accessing information via search, sharing information via social networks, localization of
content and advertising
* **Education:** sharing of ideas, collaboration, translation of research papers
* **Government:** foreign relations, negotiation
To meet these needs, technology companies are investing heavily in machine translation. This
investment and recent advancements in deep learning have yielded major improvements in
translation quality.

According to Google, switching to deep learning produced a 60% increase in translation
accuracy compared to the phrase-based approach previously used in Google Translate. Today,
Google and Microsoft can translate over 100 different languages and are approaching human-level
accuracy for many of them.
However, while machine translation has made lots of progress, it’s still not perfect. �
